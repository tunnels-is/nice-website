## Recovery Codes

When you setup two-factor authentication for the first time, you will also get some recovery codes; save them somewhere safe, and if you ever lose access to your authentication app, you can use them to recover and log in.

To use them, you need to click on `2FA Recovery` in the login screen.

1. Your email.
2. Your password.
3. One of your recovery codes.

And you can login.
