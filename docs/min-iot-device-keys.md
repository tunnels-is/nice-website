# Creating device keys for the minial / IoT client

## Step 1
Press `Organization` in the `Tunnels UI` menu and create an `Organization` to manage your `private servers`, `users`, `groups` and device keys.

## Step 2
Create a `group` and add a `private server` to it using it's `ID`.

## Step 3
Create a `device key`. The `device key` is just a string, but we recommend using UUIDs or some kind of hashes.

Once the `group` has been saved, the `device key` can be used to connect to the `private server` assigned to the same `group`
